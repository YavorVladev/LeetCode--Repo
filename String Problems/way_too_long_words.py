# Let's consider a word too long, if
# its length is strictly more than 10 characters.
# All too long words should be replaced with a special abbreviation.
#
# This abbreviation is made like this: we write down
# the first and the last letter of a word and between
# them we write the number of letters between the first
# and the last letters. That number is in decimal system
# and doesn't contain any leading zeroes.
#
# Thus, "localization" will be spelt as "l10n", and "internationalizationÂ»
# will be spelt as "i18n".
